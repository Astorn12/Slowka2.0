City's breaking down on a camel's back.
They just have to go 'cause they don't know whack
So while you fill the streets it's appealing to see
You won't get undercounted 'cause you're damned and free
You've got a new horizon it's ephemeral style.
A melancholy town where we never smile.
And all I wanna hear is the message beep.
My dreams, they got her kissing, cause I don't get sleep, no

Windmill, windmill for the land.
Turn forever hand in hand
Take it all in on your stride
It is ticking, falling down
Love forever, love is free
Let's turn forever you and me
Windmill, windmill for the land
Is everybody in?

Laughing gas these hazmats, fast cats,
Linin’ ’em up like ass cracks,
Play these ponies, at the track
It's my chocolate attack.
Shit, I'm stepping in the heart of this here
Care bear reppin' it harder this year
Watch me as I gravitate
Hahahahahaa.

Yo, we goin' to ghost town, this motown,
With yo' sound you're in the blink
Gon' bite the dust, can't fight with us
With your sound you kill the INC.
So don't stop, get it, get it
Until you're cheddar head
And watch the way I navigate

Windmill, windmill for the land.
Turn forever hand in hand
Take it all in on your stride
It is ticking, falling down
Love forever, love is free
Let's turn forever you and me
Windmill, windmill for the land
Is everybody in?


Don't stop, get it, get it
We are your captains in it
Steady, watch me navigate,
Haha Haha ha.
Don't stop, get it, get it
We are your captains in it
Steady, watch me navigate
