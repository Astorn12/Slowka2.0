In this context, there's no disrespect,
so, when I bust my rhyme, you break your necks.
We got five minutes for us to disconnect,
from all intellect collect the rhythm effect.
So lose your intuition
follow your intuition, free your inner soul
and break away from tradition.
"Cause when we be out
girl it's gonna be that
You wouldn't believe how

We Burn it till it's burned out.
Turn it till it's turned out.
Act up from north, west, east, south.
